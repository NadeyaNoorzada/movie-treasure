          <p> A film that would not normally make my watch list, but based on the cult hype and a friend's 
            recommendation, I decided to give it a watch. While I don't usually enjoy romantic stories,
            this one captivated me with its cultural richness and endearing portrayal of true love and the
             sacrifices it entails.

            Past lives is a Korean language film by A24, that follows the relationship between two childhood
             friends over the course of 24 years, as they contemplate their relationship when they grow apart
              to have different lives.
            
            The film is relatable to a vast audience as despite the love story it unpacks, it also tackles
             universal topics like love, marriage, coming of age, career, life dreams.  
            
            The dialogues are very raw and real. Beautiful camera work, colours and interesting angles that
             are able to show how the rest of the world disappears when the main characters are together.
              When there is an absence of dialogue, the non-verbal communication forces the audience closer
               into the characters, showcasing their intimacy. 
            
            The only criticism on this film for me is the pace, the film does move pretty slow for my liking,
             however this is an understandable technique used to allow the viewers the time to absorb the
              emotions that flow. This is evident as even despite its lack of action, indefinite climax and
               relatively slow pace, this movie was generally very engaging and kept me captivated.
