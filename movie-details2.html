          <p>Gorgeous sets and costumes, remarkable performances by Stone, Defoe and a scene-stealing
             Ruffalo cannot quite save this self-aware oddity of a movie. The story tips it hat to 
             Frankenstein, with the story of a damaged yet brilliant doctor, Godwin Baxter
              (played by a superb Willem Defoe) performing a radical, life-resurrecting procedure on
               the body of a girl who had thrown herself from London Bridge. Child-like (hint) and with no
                memories from her previous life, the girl, now named Bella Baxter (Stone) is carefully
                tutored until the day comes she wishes to see the outside world for herself and leaves
                under the dubious ‘care’ of a noted bounder, Duncan, played wonderfully by Mark Ruffalo.
               The Lisbon scenes are breathtaking and Bella’s naive embrace of new experiences are
               skillfully juxtaposed against the unexpected obsession for Bella that the cad Duncan
              is beginning to be tortured by. The second stanza onboard ‘The Ship’ was similarly
              captivating; Bella’s growing intellect and charm earning new new friends, however
              these relationships barely have time to develop before Duncan and Bella are
              unceremoniously dumped in France due to a lack of funds to pay passage. 
              It is here that the story overreaches its ambitions. The Paris story is an
              uncomfortable mess of fetishized pornography and a thin plot that really detract
              from the earlier story, leaving me squirming a little in my seat and wondering why
             this was all necessary to move the story forward. The Paris sojourn inevitably culminates
              with Bella’s return to London to be reunited with her creator and the man to whom she was
               betrothed before her adventures began, the charming yet feckless Max (Rammy Yussef). 
               Yet Bella’s past catches up with her for one more twist before she realises the truth
                of who she is and what her future should be.
